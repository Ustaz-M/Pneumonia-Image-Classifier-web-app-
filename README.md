Pneumonia Image Classifier â€“ Streamlit Web App
A web-based pneumonia detection tool built with Streamlit and a pre-trained Keras CNN model. Users can upload chest X-ray images (.jpeg, .jpg, .png) for classification as Pneumonia or Normal, with a confidence score displayed. The app features a custom background for an enhanced UI and uses Pillow for image processing. Uploaded images are resized, normalized, and fed into the model for prediction. Ideal for educational and research purposes, this tool demonstrates AI-powered medical imaging analysis but is not a substitute for professional diagnosis. Runs locally via streamlit run main.py or can be deployed on Streamlit Cloud for online access.
